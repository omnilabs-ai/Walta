Task: Hotel Booking Assistant

User Requirements:
- Location: San Francisco
- Room Type: Deluxe Room
- Hotel Chain: Marriott
- Priority: Best value considering both price and rating

Exact Query Steps:

1. Initial Vendor Filter:
   - Use get_vendors() to confirm Booking.com is available
   - Use get_products(vendorName="Booking.com") to get all Booking.com products

2. Location Filter:
   - Use get_products(vendorName="Booking.com", metadata={"location": "San Francisco"})
   - This will return all San Francisco properties

3. Hotel Chain Filter:
   - Use get_products(
       vendorName="Booking.com",
       metadata={
           "location": "San Francisco",
           "chain": "Marriott"
       }
     )
   - This narrows to Marriott properties in San Francisco

4. Room Type Filter:
   - Use get_products(
       vendorName="Booking.com",
       metadata={
           "location": "San Francisco",
           "chain": "Marriott",
           "roomType": "Deluxe"
       }
     )
   - This filters for Deluxe rooms

5. Final Selection:
   - Sort the remaining results by:
     a. Rating (highest first)
     b. Price (lowest first)
   - Present the top 3 options with:
     - Hotel name and location
     - Room type and price
     - Rating from metadata
     - Amenities from metadata
     - Cancellation policy from metadata

7. Payment Processing:
   - Once customer selects an option:
     - Use send_payment(
         productId=[selected_hotel_id],
         quantity=1,
         metadata={
             "bookingDetails": {
                 "checkIn": "[date]",
                 "checkOut": "[date]",
                 "guests": "[number]"
             }
         }
       )
   - Confirm booking details with the user asking about booking details before finalizing payment

Note: If any step returns no results, backtrack to the previous step and present alternatives with explanations of trade-offs.
